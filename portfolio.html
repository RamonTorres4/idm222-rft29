                <h2>Members' Night</h2>
                <p>Members' Night is a night that the Academy offers to it's
                    members once a year. It's a fantastic event where the museum
                    opens up the research areas and scientists can show off
                    their incredible work and research to members.</p>
                <p>I've worked Members' Night over the years, and I have
                    captured some really great images that really shows off the
                    collection. Here are some of my favorites.</p>

            <h3>Eagles Parade</h3>
            <section>
                <p>This was the first time ever that the Eagles won the
                    superbowl and I needed to be out taking photos to celebrate
                    the occasion.</p>

                <h3>Halloween Animations</h3>
                <p>In 2019, I challenged myself to make 31 different animations
                    for each day of October, leading up to Halloween. It was a
                    tough experience to have one done for each day and to make
                    something creative. Overall it was a fun and challenging
                    experience. Here are some of my favorite.</p>
