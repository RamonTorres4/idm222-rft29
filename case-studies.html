            <section> <h2>Plastic-free Philly</h2>
                <p>During the summer of 2023, I was tasked with a project that
                    would help launch a marketing campaign named: Plastic-free
                    Philly. This campaign’s goal was to get people to reduce the
                    number of single-use plastics that each person used to
                    reduce their carbon footprint. We would do this by selecting
                    ten different artists, all which used plastic to create art
                    installations. This was to show how much plastic people used
                    on a day-to-day basis. Those installations would be
                    displayed all around the Center City and West Philadelphia
                    areas to bring awareness to the number of single-use
                    plastics being used.</p>
                <p>My role in this project was to film each artist interview,
                    schedule those artists, edit their interviews together with
                    b-roll from the artists to tell their story, their feelings
                    on single-use plastics, and how people could make a
                    change.</p>
                <p>Not only did I create videos for each artist, but I also
                    created slides for each project that was used during the
                    press event for this project. The project took 2 months to
                    complete with each video being displayed at their respective
                    art installations. It was a tough but wonderful experience,
                    working together with some amazing people.</p>

                <h2>ANS Website Design</h2>
                <p>July of this year, I started on the implementation of the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences new website. This site was
                    designed several years ago by a design agency but due to a
                    multitude of problems arising, this site has not been
                    implemented before July.</p>
                <p>When the project was started, I was not very hands on with
                    the decisions that were being made but due to budget
                    restraints, my boss was let go and I was thrust into the
                    position of technical lead on this project, with support
                    from my new boss, I am closing in on completing this
                    project. The implementation of this project started in
                    September of this year and is ongoing. Since I took on the
                    role of technical lead, I had the following duties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to read and understand documentation and make sure
                        that templates and components match up with the
                        technical roadmap.</li>
                    <li>How to follow design guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Curated photographs to use for the new site, including
                        replacing decades old photos, as well as writing alt
                        text for each image.</li>
                    <li>Reviewing and fixing pages that were imported from
                        WordPress during a migration to ensure that they all
                        followed the intended design.</li>
                    <li>Working with an external partner to ensure that the site
                        does not lose ranking with Google by using 301 and 404
                        redirects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project is ongoing but is drawing closer to wrapping up.
                    It has been a lot but once again, I am working with great
                    people.</p>
