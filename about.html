                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>My name is Ramon Torres. My pronouns are (He/Him/His) I am a
                    photographer, videographer, and web content manager for the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. I've been
                    working in museums for as long as I can remember. I started
                    when
                    I was 13 years old as a volunteer working with animals and
                    now I
                    do so much more.</p>
                <p>As a graduate from Community College of Philadelphia, I honed
                    my
                    skills of photography and videography. I took night classes
                    at
                    Moore, College of Art, getting my certification and learning
                    about motion graphics and design. Now I am currently a
                    student
                    of Drexel University, working on completing my bachelor's
                    degree.</p>
                <p>I love visual arts but my passion is photography and
                    videography.
                    I love creating wonderful images by using lighting to get
                    different effects. In my day job, I don't get to do a lot of
                    creative lighting work but when I do, it's a fun
                    challenge.</p>
