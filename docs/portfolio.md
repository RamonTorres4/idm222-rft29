### Members Night
Members' Night is a night that the Academy offers to it's members once a year. It's a fantastic event where the museum opens up the research areas and scientists can show off their incredible work and research to members.

I've worked Members' Night over the years, and I have captured some really great images that really shows off the collection. Here are some of my favorites.

### Halloween Animations
In 2019, I challenged myself to make 31 different animations for each day of October, leading up to Halloween. It was a tough experience to have one done for each day and to make something creative. Overall it was a fun and challenging experience. Here are some of my favorite.
